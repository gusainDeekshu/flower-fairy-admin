• Industry configurations
• Theme settings
• Business metadata

This architecture allows the system to scale into a **multi-brand platform**.

---

## 📊 Smart Data Synchronization

Using **TanStack Query**, the system ensures data is always up-to-date while minimizing unnecessary API calls.

Features include:

• Intelligent caching
• Background data refresh
• Mutation tracking
• Optimistic UI updates

This provides a fast and responsive experience even under heavy workloads.

---

# 🔄 Admin Workflow Lifecycle

### Product Management Flow

Admin → Create Product → Validate via Zod → Send API request → Update cache via TanStack Query

---

### Order Processing Flow

Customer places order → Backend updates order → Admin 
 auto-syncs → Admin updates fulfillment status

---

### Authentication Flow

Admin login → JWT generated → Stored securely → Protected routes unlocked → Session validation on refresh

---

# 🔐 Security Considerations

The 
 includes several security mechanisms:

Protected routes
Token-based authentication
Schema validation with Zod
Input sanitization
Role-based UI restrictions

These practices reduce risks such as:

Unauthorized access
Invalid API payloads
Data corruption

---

# 📈 Performance Optimizations

Several performance strategies were implemented:

Server Components for lighter client bundles
TanStack Query caching
Lazy-loaded modules
Optimized data fetching
Minimal re-renders
